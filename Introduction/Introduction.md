This is a very very basic example of getting started with Elm. It is just printing the text 'Welcome to Elm!'. In this example we have an import keyword, which imports a Html package into our program, and then we have exposing, which means we want to import only the text attribute of Html package. 

You will learn more about packages as you go through this guide.

We then have a 'main', where we interact with the exposed 'text' attribute from the Html package. and it prints the text.

You can change the text to whatever you want.
